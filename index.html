    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <p> <!-- paragraph -->
      A <b>chocolate chip cookie</b> is a drop cookie that features chocolate chips or chocolate morsels as its distinguishing ingredient. Chocolate chip cookies are claimed to have originated in the <i>United States in 1938</i>, when <strong>Ruth Graves Wakefield</strong> chopped up a <em>Nestl√©</em> semi-sweet chocolate bar and added the chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe; however, historical recipes for grated or chopped chocolate cookies exist prior to 1938 by various other authors.
